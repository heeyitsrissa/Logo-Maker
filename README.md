# Logo-Maker

## Description
This Challenge we were asked to build a logo maker where the user will be prompted with with questions asking for the text which could only be up to 3 character long, the text color, the shape which should appear as a list, and and the color of the shape once that information is recorded from the user the user should see text stating the creation of the svg file was successful. Once that svg file is created the user can open the logo in the web browser. I belive the easiest part of this challange was the inquirer prompt since we have been doing it quite a lot in this module and module 9. the biggest challenge would be the testing part, it was odd writing a test for a code that wasnt written yet.

## Installation
To start this project I did the easiest part first, which was coding the index.js. next I started on writing the test for the shapes, that part was a little harder to figure out where to start so I had to do some outside research to figure out how I should right these test. Next I wrote the shapes js files and texted to code to make sure the tests passed. Lastly I made sure the index.js wrote an index.html so the logo could be opened in the browser.

## Usage
When the user runs the index.js file they are presented with with questions about their logo including the text which can be up to three characters long, if the test is longer an alert will show in terminal telling the user there can only be 3 characters used. Users  will be asked the text color, as well as a list of ther available shapes that can be used in the logo and the color of those shapes. Once all information is retrieved from the users the logo.svg and index.html will be created.
